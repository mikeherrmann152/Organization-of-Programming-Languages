This is my README file

I thought overall this assignment to be interesting. It was very challenging for me to be able to see the different languages and understand what was goin on in them. I think the easiest ones were python and C#. This is because I already knew a lot of python so making this program wasn't to hard. And when it came to understanding the C# code it looked similar to C and C++ code I have seen a lot of in the past. One thing for sure I know that i didn't like was not having iterators. Iterators made understanding and wrtiting the code much easier in my opinion.
